ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Enri Arn, a developer passionate about frontend development and designing user interfaces. I mainly use Angular for the frontend and NestJS for the backend, with a MongoDB database to cover all bases.

ðŸ”§ Occasionally, I find myself doing some backend work, although I much prefer the frontend world. I also have knowledge of React and a bit of Flutter.

ðŸŒŸ I love creating engaging and intuitive user experiences and am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to improve my skills.
